**Description**
The talented and highly motivated individual will contribute to different projects in the Tiziani Lab, focusing on cancer metabolism applying and developing untargeted metabolomics/lipidomics and 13C-metabolic flux analyses using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The metabolic data of cellular model systems, as well as human biofluids and tissue samples, will be combined with high-throughput/ content screening data to understand how drug-induced modulation of tumor metabolism and nutrient microenvironment affect treatment outcome for resistant cancer disease settings. The lab is actively working on developing novel combinatorial drug treatment and testing chemotherapeutic efficacy on multiple clinical trials.


**Requirements**
Candidates must have a Ph.D. degree in Analytical Chemistry, Chemical Biology, Pharmacology, and Bioengineering or in a related field. The position requires a strong background in LC-MS/MS. Proficiency in programming and/or scripting languages appropriate for labeled and unlabeled metabolic data analysis (e.g. Matlab, R, etcâ€¦) is preferred. The candidate is expected to maintain mass spectrometry instrumentation, train graduate students, procure postdoctoral fellowship funding and assist in the writing of grant applications. A person is eligible for a position as postdoctoral research fellow if he or she has obtained a PhD no more than four years before obtaining the Ph.D. degree. The position is a one-year term appointment with the possibility of renewal for up to five years based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds, and ongoing operational needs.
