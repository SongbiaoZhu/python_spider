**Description**
A permanent bioinformatics research scientist position is available for motivated candidates in the Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, a premier center for biomedical investigation located in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The Center develops the state-of-the-art technologies for mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics, and systems biology tools for multi-omics data integration. The overarching aim is to apply these tools to basic science and clinical challenges, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention of human diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. In addition to extensive collaborative projects, the candidate will have an opportunity to lead scientific projects for career development. St. Jude is a top ranked hospital (#1 for pediatric cancer specialty in U.S. in 2017) and a world-class basic research institute with ~300 faculty members. Staff scientists at St. Jude are provided with very competitive salary in an affordable city. The candidate shall have a Ph.D. degree related to bioinformatics, such as analysis of genome sequencing, RNAseq, mass spectrometric data, or biological pathways. The candidate will be expected to have at least two (2) years of experience directly in the field of proteomics and/or metabolomic data analysis. The candidate will be expected to have expertise in developing computer algorithms, statistical methods, or scientific software. OR, if the candidate holds a Ph.D with no bioinformatics research, at least two years of experience in Computational Biology is required. Experience with programming languages such as Perl, C, Java or Python is required.


**Requirements**
EDUCATION AND/OR TRAINING: Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, or related field required. Two (2) years of relevant and productive postdoctoral experience in proteomics and/or metabolomics data analysis required. EXPERIENCE: Two (2) years of postdoctoral experience in proteomics and/or metabolomics data analysis is required. Experience with programming languages such as Perl, C, Python, or Java is required. Ph.D. training with experience related to bioinformatics (such as analysis of genomic data, microarrays, SNPs, image data, proteomic data, or biological pathways; development of algorithms, statistical methods, or scientific software) is highly preferred. Candidate must have an excellent publication record (e.g. first author publication of software).
