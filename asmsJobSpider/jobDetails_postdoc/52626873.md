**Description**
The McMeniman group at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD is activity recruiting a postdoctoral research associate to study human scent chemistry using thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS). We seek a highly motivated, proactive individual with demonstrated experience in GC/MS and/or related analytical approaches to support an interdisciplinary research project aimed at defining the molecular and cellular basis of mosquito attraction to human scent. The recruited individual will be primarily be responsible for TD-GC/MS method creation, optimization and analysis of headspace samples derived from humans differing in attractiveness to mosquitoes. An applied goal of this research will be to engineer synthetic human scent mimics that effectively trap mosquitoes to combat diseases such as malaria, dengue and Zika.   The recruited postdoctoral scientist will have considerable freedom to develop related-research projects according to their interests within the collaborative environment at Johns Hopkins, and further contribute towards product development resulting from this research to improve public health. Analytical chemists with basic and applied interests in topics such as the human volatome, the microbiome, infectious diseases and chemosensory biology are encouraged to apply. Post-doctoral scientists will be compensated according to the NIH rate commensurate with experience:https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-036.html The McMeniman Group (http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/131) studies mosquito chemosensory neurobiology and is affiliated to the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Bloomberg School of Public Health; and Department of Neuroscience, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. Our laboratory houses state-of-the-art facilities for GC/MS, two-photon microscopy and mosquito behavioral analysis, and has established a large semi-field facility for screening inter-individual differences in mosquito attraction to humans in Macha, Zambia. Anticipated start date for this position is March 1, 2020 or thereafter. Interested candidates should should email a cover letter stating specific interest and career goals along with their CV to: Dr Conor McMeniman Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 615 N.
