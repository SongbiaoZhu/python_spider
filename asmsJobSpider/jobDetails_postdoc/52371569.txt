**Description**
A postdoctoral position is available in Dr. Linlin Zhao’s laboratory at the Department of Chemistry of the University of California, Riverside. The postdoctoral fellow will work on an NIH-funded project focused on understanding the mechanism of mitochondrial DNA degradation (please see recent publications, PMIDs 31413200, 31627882). The laboratory has strong expertise in protein biochemistry, enzymology, DNA damage and repair, and mitochondrial genomic maintenance. Molecular biology, mammalian cell culture, proteomics techniques are also used. For details, please visit https://zhaolab.ucr.edu. The position offers an excellent training opportunity in mitochondrial biology with an emphasis on biochemistry, quantitative proteomics, and bioinformatics approaches. Besides, the fellow will have the opportunity to hone his/her skills in scientific communication, student supervising, and lab management. We welcome and support scientists with diverse backgrounds who are energetic and highly motivated for career advancement. UC Riverside has a vibrant research environment (including 12 current NAS members and 2 Nobel Laureates). The Zhao Lab is housed in the state-of-the-art Multidisciplinary Research Building, UCR’s newest and largest research building. The campus is close to other universities, research institutes, and biotech industries in Southern California. Riverside was recently named as one of America's top ten Most Livable Communities, with ample cultural and entertainment opportunities in a safe and affordable community. The Pacific Ocean is located about 1-hour west of campus, while the San Bernardino Mountains and ski areas are located about 1-hour east. The city offers all the cultural advantages of any U.S. city, together with the fantastic all-year-round weather of sunny Southern California.


**Requirements**
A successful candidate should have a doctoral degree in analytical chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, or related field, and a strong background in proteomics. A candidate with a strong background in quantitative proteomics or proximity-based labeling methods is preferred. Interested applicants should send a CV, a 1-page research statement, and the names/contact information of three references to Dr. Zhao at linlin.zhao@ucr.edu.
