# Gene nomenclature and style

[source](https://www.jci.org/kiosk/publish/genestyle)

Please ensure that the gene and protein terms used throughout your article adhere to the guidelines provided below.

# Official gene symbols

Official [NCBI Gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/)  full names and symbols are preferred, although “Other Aliases” will be  accepted. The Editors acknowledge that exceptions to these guidelines  exist, and these will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Do not use

- Superscripts or subscripts (e.g., *CB1*, not *CB1* or *CB1*)
- Hyphens (e.g., *TNFA*, not *TNF-A*); an exception is *Caenorhabditis elegans* gene symbols
- Greek letters: revise as Latin alphabet equivalents (e.g., *TNFA*, not *TNF*α; *PPARG*, not *PPAR*γ)
- Roman numerals: revise as Arabic numerals (e.g., *ABCG1*, not *ABCGI*)

# Italicization

Do italicize

- Gene symbols (e.g., *PPARG*)
- Genotypes (e.g., *PPARG–/–*)
- mRNAs (e.g., *PPARG* mRNA)
- cDNAs

Do not italicize

- Gene names (e.g., “the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ gene”)
- Gene products (e.g., “the gene encoding PPARγ”)
- Phenotypes

# Capitalization

Capitalization of gene and protein symbols should be styled according to species. For example,

Humans and non-human primates:

- Full name: peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ
- Gene symbol: *PPARG*
- Protein symbol: PPARγ

Mice and rats:

- Full name: peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ
- Gene symbol: *Pparg*
- Protein symbol: PPARγ

Note that full names of genes and proteins start with a  lower-case letter unless they begin with a person’s name (describing a  disease/phenotype) or a capitalized abbreviation.
